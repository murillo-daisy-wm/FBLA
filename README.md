# FBLA
An app is to be created that allows FBLA members to interact and share their opinions on style, fashion, and attire.
Users can snap a picture with their phone. They can share what they want to know—things like (a) Is this outfit stylish?, (b) Is this outfit professional?, (c) Is this outfit within the FBLA‐PBL dress code?, (d) What should I change to make this outfit better?, and other important details.
It should allow users to post outfits and interact with anyone else who has posted outfits.
